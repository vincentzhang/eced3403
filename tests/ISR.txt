You need to add that to the very beginning of the emulator to set up the stack and the interrupt vecto




Then this is the code, and the s record:

!Timer ISR at location 0x01000
SECTION 	PROGRAM
ORIGIN	%1000

LD		%00,#%00	!Write 0 to port 0 to disable timer
IRET				!Return to main

!Main program
ORIGIN	%000C

LD		%FB,%81	!Enable timer interrupts in IMR
LD		%00,%8A	!Write a delay of 20 (2 * 0x0A) to the timer
				!in free-running mode
